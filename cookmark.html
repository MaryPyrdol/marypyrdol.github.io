                    <p>CookMark is a web and mobile application designed to help users save and share recipes, from friends' recommendations to beloved family favorites across generations.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:6vh;">THE PROBLEM</p>
                    <p>Recipes are saved in all random places and often lost in bad handwriting, poor communication, or worn down recipe cards.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:6vh;">THE GOAL</p>
                    <p>Generate a way to keep all recipes in one place and easy to share with others.</p>

                <h2>Understanding the User</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:6vh;">SUMMARY</p>
                <p>For my recipe-organizing app, I conducted a competitive audit to see what has already been done to organize and share recipes digitally. I wanted to do my research this way because I was mainly concerned about how other apps displayed recipes to the user.</p>
                <p>Going into this research, I assumed formats for these apps would be very similar in layout and color, but I was pleasantly surprised to find many different ways apps displayed the data and visual themes for “food”. I got to see what I felt worked and what I felt didn’t in terms of these elements. This gave me insight for when I decide on color and layout for my app.</p>

                    <p>I want to say I started with a mobile first approach, but my paper wireframes for the website were what initially inspired me to start making mockups for the mobile version of the application.</p>

                <p>On the “Add New Recipe” page, I wanted to be accessible for people with very specific dietary restrictions. I added sections like “allergy Information” for users to add notes such as “gluten free” or “contains peanuts”.</p>

                    <p>Here I created the bare bones of the <span style="font-style:italic;">functional</span> mobile and web app to see how it would run through different sequences of the user flow. In these prototypes, you'll find many oversized buttons or wonky icons I later ironed out after plugging in actual content. Creating these lo-fi prototypes helped me fix those problem areas and create more breathable space in the final cut of the designs.</p>

                <h2>Mockups</h2>
                <p>The translation of the homepage was pretty straightforward from the lo-fi prototype. I was able to test out contrast for the call-to-action buttons and really make them pop. I also fixed minor adjustments like the logo clearing the iPhone hotbar (which should also clear other widgets on other devices).</p>
                <p>The “My Friends” page had some major improvements. I implemented a tabs function, where users can flip between seeing all of their friends and just their bookmarked friends. Users will want to bookmark their favorite users when they have consistently good recipes, especially grandma's.</p>

                    <p>I made sure to make iconography and buttons large enough for people to access them. Often times I've seen iconography too small to comprehend or touch, thus making it difficult for the user to interact with the mechanics of the app.</p>

                <p>From this project, I learned how to really simplify my designs. I often overthink the sketching phase, but I utilized that energy and put it towards making iterations to inform one final product. I also learned about how crucial it is to have the functions within the app intertwined between screens. You cannot have the user stuck at a dead-end. There are always navigational options.</p>

                <p>After designing this first prototype of what could be a very useful tool, I got to brainstormign how I could expand CookMark in future "updates" upon release:</p>
            </div>
            <div id="next-step-points">
                <div class="next-point">
                    <h3>Messaging Capabilities</h3>
                    <p>While working on the friend section, I would love to expand it to add messaging abilities for users to ask questions to the owners of recipes. This way they can communicate tips and give suggestions not listed in recipe cards.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="next-point">
                    <h3>Advanced Search</h3>
                    <p>I would also like to add the ability to search by the ingredients you have in your kitchen. The “Search Recipes” page kind of does function like that, but I feel like it could be focused more on the idea that you're searching either for a specific recipe or for anything involving certain ingredients. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="next-point">
                    <h3>Enhanced Profiles</h3>
                    <p>Lastly, I would try to add interesting prompts to the profiles. For now, I put placeholders such as “kitchen experience” because I feel like it would be interesting to see biographies about the users as you explore their profiles and what their cooking abilities are. </p>
                </div>
